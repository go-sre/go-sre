## Microservice Reliability Engineering

## Definition 
Automated
API First - 12 factor app - backing services as resources, able to failover any resource
Same principles, different focus and execution. Sense and respond vs command and control
msre SRE focus on microservices. 
Focus on layer 7 vs layer 1 - 3
Distributed nature - assume failure first, assume cascading failure, failover and proxy

## Software Engineering Focused
Baked into every service, should run out of the box.
Very software engineering focused including extension application architectures that fovor simplicity
Observability - access logging
Resiliency - ingress and egress controllers of timeout

## Architecture 
Cloud based services for SLO servicing, timeseries monitoring against objectives, and alerting
